## February 2020 - Now: HCareers

[HCareers] is a job board with a focus on the hospitality industry.

I joined as a Senior Python Engineer to work on backend and data engineering work. Since then, I became part of a newly formed Platform team with a focus on DevOps, Data Engineering and Business Intelligence.

_Technologies Used_: Python, AWS CDK (TypeScript), AWS (Fargate, EC2, S3, Lambda, Step Functions)

## May 2019 - January 2020: Loop Insights, Vancouver, BC, Canada

Loop Insights was an IoT startup with a focus on the retail market.

I joined as the first engineer in a new team being created by the new CIO. Being part of a small engineering team building out the initial product, my main focus was on backend and devops - building CI/CD pipelines, building and deploying APIs, even getting some exposure to some front-end JavaScript work; as well as improving our receipt parsing logic and ingestion pipeline.

## Aug 2014 - May 2019: Yodlee, Redwood Shores, California, USA/Vancouver, BC, Canada

[Yodlee] is a Financial Technology company focused on the aggregation side.

I worked across 2 different teams:

The _Tools & Automation_ team which was responsible for internal tools used by Operations and other teams. In this role, I built internal tools using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (LAMP), Perl and Bash.

The _Data Operations_ team which was reponsible for our Data environment that included both in-house data center and an AWS based environment. The team's main responsibility was the operations side of our growing Data Analytics business. In this role, I continued to built tools to automate cloud deployments, scale and monitor our production workloads; served on-call rotation; deployed models and Machine Learning services. I liken to this role to be a fix of Infastructure, DevOps and SRE type work. I got exposed to a mix of Cloud and Big Data tools and frameworks - Python, AWS services (S3, EC2, EMR, RedShift), Elasticsearch, Tensorflow, Hadoop and Spark. I even had the opportunity to work remotely!

I spend my days making sure stuff in production works. This entails building monitoring tools, capturing system and application data for data analysis, working with other teams to ensure smooth deployments, responding to failures, etc.
