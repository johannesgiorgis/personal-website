## Who am I

I am an experienced Software Engineer currently working at a Hospitality focused Job Board. I am a member of the Platform team, where I get the opportunity to work on cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, analytics and business intelligence.

I spend my evenings learning and exploring various areas of Software Engineering & Data Science. I am most excited about Data Analytics/Science, Artificial Intelligence and building data products and intelligent applications.

## What is this blog about

This blog chronicles my current technical journey into AI. I write about my learnings while taking courses, building and deploying applications.

I use [Hugo] to build my blog and [Netlify] to host it.

You can read about [how I build this site].
