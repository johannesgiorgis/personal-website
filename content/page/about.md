# Who am I?

I am an experienced Software Engineer currently remotely working for a Financial Technology company on the operations side of its Data Analytics business.

I spend my days making sure stuff in production works. This entails building monitoring tools, capturing system and application data for data analysis, working with other teams to ensure smooth deployments, responding to failures, etc.

I spend my evenings learning and exploring Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and building data products and intelligent applications.

# What is this blog about?

This blog chronicles my current technical journey into AI. I write about my learnings while taking courses, building and deploying applications.

I use [Hugo] to build my blog and [Netlify] to host it.

You can read about [how I build this site].
