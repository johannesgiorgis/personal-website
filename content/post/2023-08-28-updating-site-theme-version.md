How is theme set up? Via git submodule

## How to Update Theme

I was rolling with an older version of my theme for a while.

You can see from below that it was using `$0.4.8-BETA` tag.

```sh
# Within theme folder
personal-website/themes/tranquilpeak (#0.4.8-BETA)
```

Running `git tag`, we can see the tag we are on is 4 releases behind the current one.

```sh
Î»  g tag           
0.1.0-ALPHA
...
0.4.8-BETA
0.5.0-BETA
0.5.1-BETA
0.5.2-BETA
0.5.3-BETA
```

So how can we update it? Remember, this is a git submodule. So we can simply run `git checkout <tag>` to switch to our desired tag.

Initially, I went straight to the latest tag and ran `hugo server -Dwv` and saw several errors:

- Missing icons
- Missing pictures

So I had to do the release one step at a time and checking against the [Releases page](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/releases). Going through this process led me to a realization:

- Reading through the releases educates you about additional improvements that have been made that you can take advantage of via small changes to your code
    - These changes can be in the direct tool or underlying packages it is using. In this case there were updates to Font Awesome v5 which led to icon changes, changes to table of contents due to Hugo's markdown engine changes, etc.
- Test each release separately and catch its changes in corresponding commits. We can always rebase later to rename and squash commits to get our final result.
- Making small changes keeps it simple for you to track what is going on and at what point.

So what does the process look like?

1. Run hugo locally via `hugo server -Dvw`, ideally in a separate terminal and open your blog.
1. Navigate to theme folder and check out the next release via `git checkout <tag>`.
1. Look at your blog for any obvious breaking changes - images, icons, text not loading, broken links, etc. Admittedly this process is not very thorough and doesn't guarantee that everything will work. I hope to improve this somehow in the near future.
    1. Debug any issues that come up by comparing against previous version (yes, this will require checking out the previous tag), reading up on the list of changes within the releases page and some trial and error.

NOTE: The most interesting issue came from a coverImage not loading properly for one of my articles. Comparing the respective versions (#0.5.1-BETA vs #0.5.0-BETA) led to no obvious changes that would have led to a broken cover image. I found the fix by searching the theme repo for any mentions of `coverImage` and seeing how it was used in the exampleSite.

The difference was in the example site, they didn't include `https:`, but everything that came afterwards. This minor change got my cover image loading again ðŸŽ‰ and I was unblocked!

Once its working, commit and push. Changes to the `themes/<theme-name>` will be included.

And voila! That's how you update to newer versions of your desired theme!

## Switching to own fork

Earlier I tried switching to a more up to date theme (`Papermod`) but once my site up and running, I already missed the old theme. Worst yet I had to make so many changes - disabling a bunch of short codes and other functionality to get the theme to load my site somewhat properly.

There's no way around it - the tranquilpeak and the [Hexo Tranquilpeak theme](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) it is based on are beautiful themes. I wanted to get back to it, but I needed to update it and potentially customize some more. Lacking in meaningful Front End skills, I had previously tweaked and customized the theme via overrides by using the `layouts` directory to specify small changes that I wanted. But something larger like updating and upgrading would require more work and more overrides in the `layouts` directory which doesn't seem maintainable.

Until I came across this repo - https://github.com/lijqhs/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/tree/master. The owner had forked and made some adjustments to the theme.

A brilliant outcome of this strategy was that you could now have your custom theme separate from your content and have more freedom to make necessary changes or experiment with the theme without polluting your content. Better yet, the changes the owner had made seemed like ones I could adopt and build upon.

So once I did the theme version update, I switched to my forked version which required some switcheroo as I ultimately wanted to use the same theme folder name, only change the remote location :)

And I got it working. Next is the part where I update my new forked theme but that is a separate repo now - https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme.
