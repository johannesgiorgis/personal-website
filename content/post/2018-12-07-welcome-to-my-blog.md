Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog :)
<!--more-->

## Who am I?

I am an experienced Software Engineer currently working for FinTech company on the operations side of our Data Analytics business.

I spend my days making sure stuff in production works. This entails building monitoring tools, capturing system and application data for data analysis, working with other teams to ensure smooth deployments, responding to failures...etc.

I spend my evenings learning and exploring Data Science, Artificial Intelligence topics as well as building data products.

## Why did I start this blog?

Since I started my career in Software Development, there are so many things I have learnt, both technical and non-technical. As I reflected on these learnings, I realized I had wanted to document them.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about other Software Development topics, so I enroll in various MOOCs, work on projects. As part of this, I experimented with different methods of documenting my learnings: attempting a [#100DaysOfCode] challenge focused on my coding abilities and logging my progress via git, creating course specific repositories to host my notes and collect various learning resources.

In late 2018, I got involved with the [Vancouver School of AI meetup] and started creating content, presentations and demo apps to share with the community.

Over the past year, I have completed Udacity's Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree programs. I realize I had not done a great job of retaining a lot of the information I had learnt. One way to do this is to build projects, applications and write about it as I learn.

All this led me to want to have a central place to house my learnings along with interesting articles and resources I come across.

My plan for this blog is to document my technical journey (currently into AI) and to share my learnings with you :)

I use [Hugo] to build my blog and [Netlify] to host it.

You can read about [how I build this site].
