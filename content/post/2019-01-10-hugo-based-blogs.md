Some Hugo based blogs I came across and used for references.

<!--more-->

To build my blog, I used the [Hugo Quick Start] guide to get started. Once I got it up, I had to do research to enable features, to deploy it using Netlify and to troubleshoot whenever I got stuck or couldn't get something to work exactly as I wanted. I came across various types of Hugo based blogs which I used for references to figure out how people had designed their websites and how I could emulate similar functionality on my website. Specifically, I would search for their repositories to see the code and configuration that powered these websites.

I wanted to compile these various resources into one place for future references.
