Showcasing my Data Science Challenges.

<!--more-->

Last month, I started working on [Data Science Challenges]. The challenges can be found on the [Data Science Challenges Github Repository] for anyone to fork and tackle themselves. New challenges are added as we go.

The purpose of this page is to showcase and summarize the challenges I work on. My projects can be found on my [DS Challenges Github Repository].


# Exploring Vancouver Technology Meetups via the Meetup API

The first challenge was to _use the [Meetup API] to explore Meetups in your city of choice_. I chose to explore my city, beautiful **Vancouver, BC**.

# Creating a dataset of PacktPub's content library

The second challenge was _to use web scraping to create a custom dataset_. I chose to create a dataset consisting of [PacktPub]'s content library.

_Currently working on it_
